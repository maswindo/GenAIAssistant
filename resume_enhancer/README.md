Agent Collaboration
To ensure agents avoid redundant feedback:
1. Unified Backend Logic:
    * Agents in Simple Enhance collaborate by flagging which areas they’ve already addressed.
    * For example, if the Clarity agent suggests restructuring a section, the Branding agent will avoid commenting on the same area unnecessarily.
2. Prioritization:
    * Agents prioritize feedback based on importance, ensuring the most critical issues are highlighted first.
3. Shared Context:
    * Agents share a summary of their suggestions, enabling smoother handoff from Simple to Advanced pages.

User Benefits:
1. For Simple Users: They get actionable advice without delving into unnecessary details.
2. For Advanced Users: They gain full control over refining their resumes, with detailed agent guidance on specific aspects.
3. Efficiency: No duplicate or irrelevant information. Users get precise help on what matters most.
